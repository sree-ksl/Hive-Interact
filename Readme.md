## Hive Interact
On "Hive Interact (HI)" only responsible & verified users are given access. It is a social colony where people communicate in the right way: with the ones they choose; encourage positive exchange of information; ensure a good & safe platform for all.

Every user on 'Hive Interact' has to use a ‘HI token’ for all actions like messaging, commenting, encourage/like, etc. All verified users can also stake ‘HI tokens’ to create shadow profiles, if they so choose for their interactions to keep the colony humming.
